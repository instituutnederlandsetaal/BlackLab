# Future plans

Broadly speaking, these are our plans for the future:

- Improve performance and memory requirements (ongoing)
- Keep up with new Lucene versions (ongoing)
- Scale to larger corpora by adding support for distributed search,
  through integration with Solr (in progress)
- Keep up to date with new Java versions (ongoing)
- Make accessing and highlighting the original content of documents more flexible (stored in the index or accessed through a web service)
- Enhance dependency relations search
- Integrate improvements and suggestions from the community ([issues](https://github.com/instituutnederlandsetaal/BlackLab/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/instituutnederlandsetaal/BlackLab/pulls) welcome!)

For more (somewhat technical) details, see the corresponding [BARKs](https://github.com/instituutnederlandsetaal/BlackLab/tree/dev/doc/bark#readme) (short descriptions of planned development and other information).
