# Query language: BCQL

<!-- TODO: unary negation operator -->

BlackLab Corpus Query Language or BCQL is a powerful query language for text corpora.

It is a dialect of the [CQP Query Language](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/files/CQP_Tutorial/ "http://cwb.sourceforge.net/files/CQP_Tutorial/") introduced by the IMS Corpus WorkBench (CWB). Several other corpus engines support a similar language, such as the [Lexicom Sketch Engine](https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/documentation/corpus-querying/ "https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/documentation/corpus-querying/"). The various dialects are very similar, but differ in some of the more advanced features.

This section documents the various ways to use BCQL to query your data:
- [Token-based querying](token-based.md): the most common way to query corpora, where you search for specific words or patterns in the text.
- [Relations querying](relations.md): query (dependency) relations between words or spans of text.
- [Parallel querying](parallel.md): querying your parallel corpora, finding alignments between different languages or historical versions of a text.
- [Miscellaneous](miscellaneous.md): other information about BCQL, such as operator precedence, features and comparisons with other corpus engines.
