# BARK 3 - Code style

- **type:** information

For contributors: please use your IDEs built-in code formatter to adhere to BlackLab's coding style. It is mostly standard Java style.

Configurations for IDE code formatters can be found in the [doc](../) directory.

An [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file is included as well and may be picked up by your IDE or editor automatically.
