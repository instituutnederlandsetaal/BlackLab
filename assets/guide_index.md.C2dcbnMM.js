It supports token-based querying and querying (dependency) relations.</p> <details class="details custom-block"><summary><b>What is a corpus search engine?</b></summary> <p>A corpus search engine allows you to search through large bodies of annotated text. Each word can have a number of annotations such as headword, part of speech, etc. Spans of text may be annotated, and there may be (dependency) relations between (groups of) words. You can search all of these, looking for specific patterns.</p> <p>For example, the word <em>chickens</em> would be tagged with the headword <em>chicken</em> and the part of speech <em>(plural) noun</em>.</p> <p>An example of a query could be: find adjectives occurring before the headword <em>chicken</em>. This might find matches like &quot;small chicken&quot; or &quot;black spotted chickens&quot;. Of course, much more complex queries can be crafted as well.</p> <p>You may also have annotations on spans (groups of words); for example, named entities like <em>Albert Einstein</em> or <em>The Eiffel Tower</em>. Other tags could include paragraphs and sentences. You can incorporate all these annotations in your queries as well.</p> <p>Even if your corpus does not include annotations, you can still benefit from other features that a corpus engine provides, such as sorting hits by the word before the hit, or grouping on the matched text.</p></details> <p>BlackLab was designed primarily for linguists, but is also used for other purposes, like historical research and knowledge extraction.</p> <p>It is available as a web service, allowing you to use it from any programming language.</p> <p>BlackLab was developed at the <a href="https://ivdnt.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dutch Language Institute</a>.
